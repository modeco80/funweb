## Funweb

A "Fun" C++17 web-application development library, with multiple planned backends.
Designed to allow switching through backends with relative ease.

## Current Backends

- uWS ([uWebSockets](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets))
	- Highest performance, cross-platform, generally the best one
	- Despite it's name, it's also very good at HTTP as well
	- Promotes asynchronous usage
	- Will probably be the most maintained backend

## Compiling

By default Funweb will use the uWS backend unless an option to override backend is provided.

## Usage

TODO
